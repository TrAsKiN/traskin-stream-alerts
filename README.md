## How to add TrAsKiN Stream Alerts in OBS Studio?

### Add alerts display

* Add a **browser source** in the *scene* where you want to add the alerts
* In the **URL** field use the following address: **https://traskin.github.io/traskin-stream-alerts/overlay.html**
* Set the **width** and **height** of the source to match your *screen resolution*

It is normal that you still do not see the alerts display if you have not logged in.

### Add the dashboard

* In the *OBS Studio* menu **View** then **Docks**, click on **Custom Browser Docks...**.
* In the **Dock Name** column enter `Dashboard`
* In the **URL** column enter **https://traskin.github.io/traskin-stream-alerts/**

A window appears in which you can log in. You can anchor this window anywhere in OBS Studio.
